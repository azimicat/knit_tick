## Description

KnitTick is an application that helps knitters to track their row count. It simplifies the knitting process by keeping count of your rows, so you can focus on your stitches. The application is simple, efficient, and designed with knitters in mind.

## Features

- **Row Count Tracker**: Easily track the number of rows you have knitted. The count can be incremented or decremented with a simple click of a button.

- **Persistent Count**: The application keeps the count even when it is closed. The next time you launch the application, you can continue from where you left off.

- **Settings Page**: Configure settings like 'screen off timeout' according to your preferences.

## Installation

KnitTick is built in Flutter and can be built for both Android and iOS devices. Follow the standard Flutter application building steps for the platform of your choice.

## Usage

On launching the application, you are presented with the main screen. It displays the count of the rows that have been knitted. You can increment the count using the '+' button and decrement it using the '-' button.

The settings button on the bottom right of the screen leads you to the settings page. Here, you can set the 'screen off timeout' to your preferred value using a slider.
